            The automated security scan has detected potential vulnerabilities in the Town of Wiley website.

            ### Required Actions:
            1. Review the security scan results in the workflow logs
            2. Update vulnerable dependencies immediately
            3. Check for exposed secrets or sensitive data
            4. Verify all security patches are applied

            ### Compliance Note:
            As a government website, maintaining security standards is critical for:
            - Protecting citizen data
            - Meeting federal security requirements
            - Maintaining public trust

            **This issue should be addressed within 24 hours.**
