# Sass Deprecation Warnings - Status and Solutions

## Current Status
✅ **Site builds successfully** - Warnings are deprecations, not errors  
✅ **All functionality working** - No impact on site operation  
⚠️ **Deprecation warnings present** - From Minima theme's outdated Sass syntax

## Warning Details
The deprecation warnings are coming from:
1. **@import rules** - Will be replaced by @use in Dart Sass 3.0.0
2. **lighten() and darken() functions** - Will be replaced by color.scale() and color.adjust()
3. **Global built-in functions** - Need to use @use "sass:color" module

## Source of Warnings
- **Minima theme v2.5.2** - Uses legacy Sass syntax
- **Jekyll gem dependencies** - Theme files in vendor/bundle directory
- **Not project code** - Coming from external theme, not our custom files

## Solutions

### Immediate Solution (Recommended)
The warnings are **deprecation notices only** and do not affect functionality. The site builds and works perfectly. No immediate action required.

### Future-Proofing Options

#### Option 1: Suppress Warnings (Simple)
Add to `_config.yml`:
```yaml
sass:
  quiet_deps: true
  style: compressed
```

#### Option 2: Override Theme Styles (Advanced)
Create `_sass/minima_overrides.scss` with modern Sass syntax:
```scss
@use "sass:color";

$brand-color: #92400e !default;
$grey-color: #6b7280 !default;
$grey-color-light: color.scale($grey-color, $lightness: 81.6%) !default;
$grey-color-dark: color.scale($grey-color, $lightness: -49%) !default;
```

#### Option 3: Switch to Modern Theme (Long-term)
- Consider migrating to a more modern Jekyll theme
- Or create custom CSS without legacy dependencies

## Timeline
- **Current**: Warnings only, no functional impact
- **Dart Sass 3.0.0 release**: Will need to address before that version
- **Estimated timeline**: 12-18 months based on Sass roadmap

## Recommendation
**No immediate action required.** The site works perfectly with these deprecation warnings. Consider addressing when:
1. Dart Sass 3.0.0 is released
2. You need to update the theme for other reasons
3. The warnings become disruptive to development workflow

## Implementation Status
✅ File conflict resolved  
✅ Navigation properly wired  
✅ Main page optimized  
✅ Build process working  
⚠️ Sass warnings (non-blocking deprecations from theme)
