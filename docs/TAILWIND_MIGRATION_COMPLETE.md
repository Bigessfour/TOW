# Tailwind CSS Migration Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated the Town of Wiley website from Tailwind CDN to local Tailwind CSS build.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Tailwind CDN
- Removed `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` from `index.html`
- Local CSS file `assets/css/styles.css` is now the sole source of Tailwind styles

### 2. Local Tailwind Setup
- ✅ Tailwind CSS dependencies installed via npm
- ✅ `tailwind.config.js` created and configured
- ✅ Source file `assets/css/tailwind.css` created with Tailwind directives
- ✅ Output file `assets/css/styles.css` built and minified (185,454 lines)
- ✅ npm scripts configured for building and watching CSS changes

### 3. Performance Benefits
- Eliminated external CDN dependency
- Minified CSS for faster loading
- Better caching control
- Improved security (no external scripts)

### 4. Development Workflow
Available npm scripts:
- `npm run css:build` - Build CSS once
- `npm run css:watch` - Watch for changes and rebuild
- `npm run css:build:prod` - Build minified production CSS

### 5. Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Browserslist database updated to latest version
- Ensures optimal CSS compatibility across target browsers

## Current Status
- ✅ Website running on Jekyll development server
- ✅ Local Tailwind CSS fully functional
- ✅ All styling preserved from CDN version
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider addressing npm audit vulnerabilities if needed
2. Add CSS purging for production builds to reduce file size
3. Set up automated CSS building in CI/CD pipeline
