# GitHub Actions Performance Testing Fixes

## üêõ Issues Identified and Fixed

### Problem Summary

The GitHub Actions workflow for performance testing was experiencing issues due
to configuration conflicts between the workflow and Lighthouse CI configuration.

**Workflow Run**:
[Performance Testing Job](https://github.com/Bigessfour/TOW/actions/runs/15517376136/job/43686100085)

### üîß Fixes Applied

#### 1. **Fixed lighthouserc.json Configuration**

**File**: `lighthouserc.json`

**Issue**:

- Configuration tried to start its own Node.js server with `startServerCommand`
- Server tried to serve from `_site` directory (Jekyll build output)
- Conflicted with the Python HTTP server started in the workflow

**Fix**:

- Removed the `startServerCommand` to let the workflow handle server startup
- Simplified configuration to just test the URLs
- Added better Chrome flags for headless testing

#### 2. **Improved Workflow Server Startup**

**File**: `.github/workflows/qa.yml`

**Issues**:

- Poor error handling for server startup
- Insufficient wait time and retry logic
- Limited debugging information

**Fixes**:

- Enhanced server startup verification with 10 retry attempts
- Added proper error handling and debugging output
- Better curl commands to test server accessibility
- Added process ID tracking

#### 3. **Enhanced Lighthouse CI Execution**

**File**: `.github/workflows/qa.yml`

**Issues**:

- Poor error messaging
- No pre-flight checks

**Fixes**:

- Added URL accessibility check before running Lighthouse
- Better error messages and status reporting
- Explicit config file specification
- Improved continue-on-error handling

#### 4. **Added Cleanup Process**

**File**: `.github/workflows/qa.yml`

**Issue**: Server processes might not be properly cleaned up

**Fix**: Added cleanup step to kill Python HTTP server processes

#### 5. **Created Debug Tool**

**File**: `scripts/test-server.py`

**Purpose**: Local debugging script to test server setup and identify issues

- Tests server accessibility
- Verifies file serving
- Provides debugging output
- Can be used locally to reproduce CI issues

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test the server locally
python scripts/test-server.py

# Test Lighthouse CI locally (if Node.js/npm available)
npm install -g @lhci/cli
lhci autorun --config=lighthouserc.json
```

### GitHub Actions Testing

The next push to the main branch will trigger the updated workflow and test
these fixes.

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Fixes

- Server startup issues
- Lighthouse CI configuration conflicts
- Poor error reporting
- Potential hanging processes

### After Fixes

- Reliable server startup with proper verification
- Clean Lighthouse CI execution
- Better error messages and debugging
- Proper process cleanup
- Successful performance audits

## üîç Monitoring

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Next workflow run should show improved logging
2. **Review Artifacts**: Lighthouse reports should be generated successfully
3. **Performance Metrics**: Should see actual performance scores instead of
   errors

## üìù Configuration Details

### Lighthouse CI Settings

- **Tests**: 3 runs for consistent results
- **Target URL**: `http://localhost:8080/`
- **Assertions**: Warns on performance/accessibility thresholds
- **Upload**: Reports stored in temporary public storage

### Performance Thresholds

- Performance Score: ‚â• 70%
- Accessibility Score: ‚â• 90%
- Best Practices: ‚â• 80%
- SEO Score: ‚â• 80%
- First Contentful Paint: ‚â§ 4000ms
- Largest Contentful Paint: ‚â§ 5000ms

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Commit and Push**: These fixes are ready to be committed
2. **Monitor Workflow**: Watch the next GitHub Actions run
3. **Review Reports**: Check uploaded Lighthouse artifacts
4. **Adjust Thresholds**: If needed, fine-tune performance thresholds

The performance testing should now run reliably and provide valuable insights
into the website's performance characteristics.
