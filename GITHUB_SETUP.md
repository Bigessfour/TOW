# ðŸš€ GitHub Setup Instructions for Town of Wiley Website

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" button** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details:**
   - Repository name: `town-of-wiley-website` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `Official website for the Town of Wiley municipal government`
   - Set to **Public** (so GitHub Pages will work for free)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. 
**Copy the HTTPS URL** which will look like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/town-of-wiley-website.git
```

## Step 3: Tell me the URL

Once you have the repository URL, provide it to me and I'll push the code to GitHub.

## What's Already Done âœ…

- âœ… Git repository initialized locally
- âœ… All files added and committed

## What Happens Next

Once you provide the GitHub repository URL, I will:
